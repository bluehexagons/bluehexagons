Free at tournaments (tips appreciated):
* Quick controller problem diagnostics
* Shield drop notches, if there's a setup with input display
* L/R spring removal
* Removal/replacement of any button, control stick, or shells if parts are provided
* Softened buttons (by cutting rubber dome)
* Z button spring tension changes
* Rumble removal (cut wires at base, can take motor out or leave in for weight)
* Non-soldered stickbox swapping

Mods (drop off at weekly, pick up at next weekly):
* Shield drop notches ($5)
* Simple snapback removal: chip capacitor ($5†; $5 to swap values after; $3 to remove)
* Complex snapback removal: replaceable/removable capacitor w/ capacitor assortment ($15†)
* Tactile Z button: stiff ~3N ($5†), light ~1-2N ($10, on order, switches need testing first); OEM is about 0.7N w/out spring
* Tacile ABXYLR/Start/D-pad: stiff ($5† per button, D-pad is 4 buttons but can just do up) ††
* Rumble motor reattachment or clean desoldering ($5†)
* Soldered stickbox swapping ($10†)
* Digital L/R to analog ($5†)
* Other soldering-related repairs; wire broke loose, etc ($5† each)

† If ordering multiple mods that require soldering, we can negotiate a bulk discount. Discount will be less when some of the price includes a component (button, etc).

†† Irreversibly changes the PCB by removing the protective under the button. If not doing complete ABXY/D-pad set, it's advised to cut out the dome below the button, but not required. A complete set for either is $13 instead of $20. The switches I currently have are too small to reliably use with OEM ABXYLR buttons without a plug which I haven't devised yet.
