        <p>
          Antistatic, an uncompromising platform fighting game,
          has been in development since 2012 as an experimental homage
          to Super Smash Bros. Melee. It is built in a custom engine,
          written in TypeScript and C, with a 3D OpenGL graphics engine.
        </p>

        <input type="checkbox" class="expandToggle" />

        <h2>
          Tech stack
        </h2>

        <p>
          Antistatic runs on top of Node.js, with the bulk written in TypeScript.
          Native portions are written in C, and run as a Node.js addon.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The graphics engine is also split, with lower-level code written in C and OpenGL and much of the model
          manipulation, vertex rendering, and animation written in TypeScript. FreeType is used to render a dynamically-growing
          font atlas. Other libraries used include: GLEW for OpenGL bindings, SDL2 for window management, and SDL2_image for image loading. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The audio engine uses OpenAL-soft to interface with hardware. Files are OGGs, and libvorbistools is used
          to decode them.
        </p>

        <p>
          To connect to the official Wii U/Switch GameCube controller adapter, I used LibUSB to directly communicate with
          the adapter over USB.
        </p>

        <p>
          Internationalization is handled using Fluent, with the language files <a href="https://github.com/bluehexagons/antistatic-translations">available on GitHub</a>.
          (And open to pull requests!)
        </p>

        <p>
          Antistatic's matchmaking server is very simplistic, but is built in Go to run on a Linux host.
        </p>

        <p>
          Netcode is peer-to-peer and delay-based, and some infrastructure work has been done to move toward adding rollback in the future.
          It runs on UDP, with higher-level messages encoded in JSON along with a binary stream of controller snapshots.
          The engine (poorly) attempts to synchronize beginning times and input delay, poke through permissive firewalls, and gracefully handle dropped packets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Antistatic's build system is mostly automated starting from a build-free git repo,
          pulling in and installing dependencies as well as building a few binaries. The process is
          a mix of PowerShell and Bash scripts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally, Antistatic ran in a web browser. The limitations started adding up,
          and I made the decision to move to Electron and add a native add-on. When I couldn't
          squeeze the consistent performance and hardware support I felt I needed,
          I re-implemented more pieces in C and moved onto Node.js directly.

          Air Dash Online was a prototype of a fast-paced platform fighting game by JV5 Games.
          As the lead programmer, I built its custom platform fighter gameplay engine
          inside of Unity and performed all non-graphics programming.
