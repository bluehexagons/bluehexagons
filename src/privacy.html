        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Effective Date: April 11, 2025</em></p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how bluehexagons ("we", "us", or "our") handles information
          in connection with the operation of the bluehexagons.com website and related services,
          including the Antistatic game server functionalities.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect very limited information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Standard Web Server Logs:</strong> Like most web servers, ours
            automatically logs basic information about requests it receives. This typically includes
            your IP address, the date and time of your request, the page you requested, your browser type,
            and the referring page. These logs are used for standard server operation, monitoring, and security.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Game Communication Information:</strong> For online features in games like
            Antistatic that use P2P connections, we may temporarily store your IP address and network port information.
            This information is used solely to facilitate the connection between you and other players.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To operate, maintain, and secure our website and servers.</li>
          <li>To enable peer-to-peer connections for online game features.</li>
          <li>To diagnose technical problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use analytics software, tracking cookies, or third-party advertising networks on our website.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

          no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain P2P connection information long enough to facilitate the connection between players, typically seconds to minutes.
          Traffic logs are stored per server instance.
        </p>
