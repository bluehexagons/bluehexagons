<h1 id="console-and-debug">Console and debug</h1>
<p>The console can be accessed with the <code>Enter</code> key.</p>
<p>Underlying the console, there&#39;s a basic file system structure, and a simple environment inspired by Linux. The shell and scripting language are inspired by Bash. There&#39;s a bunch of nerdy stuff for anyone who wants to poke around with it, though it isn&#39;t finished yet.</p>
<p>Useful commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>config</code>: displays and allows setting of global config options, like audio/music. Settings might appear here before there&#39;s a UI for them.</li>
<li><code>tas</code>: starts recording a replay one frame at a time; <code>z</code> on the keyboard advances a frame. Can also use <code>x</code> on keyboard to start a TAS. Use <code>tas</code> command again to stop. Not guaranteed to be bug-free, as it doesn&#39;t restore many things that it really should to make working, consistent replays.</li>
<li><code>replay</code>: starts recording a replay in real time. Use <code>replay</code> command again to stop. Not guaranteed to be bug-free, either.</li>
<li><code>play</code>: plays last-recorded tas or replay.</li>
<li><code>pause</code>: pauses replays currently playing.</li>
<li><code>set-dmg [n]</code>: sets damage of all characters.</li>
<li><code>sb-dmg [n]</code>: sets damage of all sandbags.</li>
<li><code>unstale</code>: unstales all moves.</li>
<li><code>dbg</code>: check and set debug variables; list all with <code>dbg</code>, set with e.g. <code>dbg controllers on</code>.</li>
<li><code>ai</code>: check and set ai variables.</li>
<li><code>constants</code>: check and set constants, in case you&#39;ve always wanted to see what 3x knockback looks like. (<code>constant KNOCKBACK_MOD 3</code>)</li>
</ul>
